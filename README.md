# Moving Help

## Context

This project was created as a final project for my Software Engineering Immersive class at General Assembly. It was created in a weeks worth of time and I plan on developing it further to become useful for anyone using the site.

## Introduction

In coming up with ideas for my application, I wanted to build something that would not only help me, but also help others as well. For me, I plan on moving to a new residence this year, so I wanted to build something that would help facilitate that and make the process easier since it's already a large ordeal. What I first thought was the cost of new items that would need to be bought for the new place, and that's how this site came to be.
